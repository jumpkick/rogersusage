# rogersusage.py
A python script to get internet usage data for customers of [Rogers][] cable internet.

## History
- **May 30, 2017:** Updated to v2.0, which fixes the script after changes to the Rogers site broke the old version.
- **2.0.1:** Restored compatibility with requests versions below 2.15.
- **2.0.2:** Improved output of cap information on unlimited plans.
- **2.0.3:** Workaround for inconsistencies in Rogers authentication process

## Requirements
 - [Python 2.7][python]. If your Python environment defaults to Python 3, you may need to explicitly run it with Python 2.7.
 - [requests][]. Installed via `pip install requests`, `easy_install` or from [source][requests source].
 - A login for the [My Rogers][] site, used for managing your Rogers account.
 - *Optional:* the [keyring][] library. If installed, the keyring will be used to securely store passwords. The storage mechanism depends on what OS you're runningâ€”on Mac OS X, it uses the system Keychain; read the keyring lib documentation for full details.

## Usage
### Running the script
Open a command prompt, and run `python rogersusage.py`. Provide the full paths to the python executable and the script as necessary.

### Configuration
The script will prompt for a My Rogers login ID (typically an email address) and password. You can also provide one with the command line parameters: `-l USERNAME` (or `--login=USERNAME`) and `-p PASSWORD` (or `--password=PASSWORD`). These will supersede any stored login details.

### Options
 - `-h`, `--help`
    - Print a help message with a description of the options
 - `-t`, `--totals`
    - Output only the total usage and usage allowance amounts.
 - `--csv`
    - Print the data only (no labels or units) as comma-separated values. Format: Download,Upload,Total,Cap Amount,Remaining Usage. Units: GB. Useful for importing or parsing the data into other programs. Remaining usage will be empty on unlimited plans.
 - `-l USERNAME`, `--login=USERNAME`
    - Rogers login ID
 - `-p PASSWORD`, `--password=PASSWORD`
    - Rogers login password
